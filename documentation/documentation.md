# Day 1: 11-27-22
My sister made soem tik toks about gift ideas for Chirstmas and she started to get lots of views on her videos. 

I said that's cool are you making any money from it? She said no so I told her my idea. The idea was to make an affiliate site that different lists of good presents, each item containing an affiliate link.

I wanted to K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid). So I would only focus on making the home page and card element for mobile.

Next I needed content for my card elements. I wanted my sister to be involved since she was already making these wishlist, so I needed a backend where a non-coder can easily put in data for each list.

I went through multiple backend options and ultimatley setteled with Sanity.io for it's price to host the backend(free) and because the excellent documentation that did not assume I knew everything.

1. My backend hosted online so my sister and I can create lists and earn a little side income.

2. My frontend was hosted with Netlify and I set up a domain(begiftable.com)

Before I start I have a list of ideas to improve the current state of the site.
1. Improve the backend schema so the card inputs are part of a specific list.
2. Instead of a menu, I will just have a side-scroll bar for all list categories. 
3. Wishlist menu item can instead be positioned absolute and you will be able to access it anytime on the page to see your favorite items.
4. Improve card aesthetics. 
    * Add wishlist functionality to left side of cards.
    * Make it more obvious you can click and buy (maybe a button on the price and underline on the product title)
5.
